                    This project was the third and final project in the sequence for EECS 494: Game Design and Development.

                    <div>
                        This was a group project where we were tasked with going through the 
                        entire game design and development process. We started by ideating what
                        we wanted our game to look like, what were the goals going to be, how
                        did we want to achieve these goals. We then moved to designing the game,
                        what do we want the player to look like, how do we want the players to interact?
                        Finally we moved into development, the long six week process of iteration after
                        every playtest, wondering if our game was ever going to make it to what we
                        had envisioned all that time ago. Many late nights, cramming in bug fix after
                        bug fix, cutting things that we didn't have time to do. All to come out on the 
                        other end with a game that people enjoyed and had fun playing. What a rollercoaster
                        this project was.

                    <div>
                        This was an individual project where we were tasked with designing a video game.
                        The relative length of the project was short, the goal was to form an idea, and 
                        develop a very basic version of that game, sort of like a proof of concept. 
                        I decided I wanted to create a puzzle game because I wanted to focus on the Level
                        design. It was incredibly rewarding showing off my game to fellow classmates, friends,
                        and family. Seeing their reactions as well as learning the game infront of my eyes
                        was so cool! It was also awesome seeing the different ways that people would take on
                        each level, allowing me to iterate and fix potential bugs.

                        This was a partner project where we had to chose between recreating the first dungeon in "The Legend of Zelda" or "Metroid". 
                        This project was the starting point for learning all the different parts of Unity and the C# language. The main contributions I made 
                        to the game were: Link Movement & Animations, Keese, Stalfos, Goriya, Pushable Blocks, Old Man Room, 2D Room, Door Transitions, 
                        Enemy Spawning & De-Spawning Revamp, Audio Additions, Custom Level Design, and Custom Level Creation.

                    For this project I was tasked to make any website I wanted. Having always wanted to create a portfolio + fun
                    website I took the opportunity to make a<a href="https://timmermj10.github.io/personal_website_339/" target="_blank">Personal
                    Website</a>. I will use the website to list out completed, both personal and class, as well as future and in progress projects. I also plan to include sections about what I do outside of the classroom for fun including sections about video games, skateboards, and "food tech". I've also always enjoyed websites that have light/dark mode sliders to change the color theme of the website, so I took the time to find a YouTube tutorial for the CSS/looks of the slider, as well as implementing the change of color using JS. The last piece was adding cookies to make sure that the color theme that you have set on one page will transfer over to the other pages on the site, as well as making it so when you return, your preferred color theme will still be in use!

                    This project was the fourth and final project in the sequence for EECS 484: Database Management Systems. For this project we had to implement the partition and probing steps for the popular database management algorithm: Grace Hash Join. The implementation mainly relied on the use of given helper functions as well as a given Bucket method. The basic idea for the partition phase is:
                    <li>Loop through all left pages</li>
                    <li>Loop through all left records</li>
                    <li>Hash the key of the record and place the record in an in memory hash table</li>
                    <li>Flush the B-1 hash table pages to disk for use in the Probing phase</li>
                    <li>Repeat for the right input</li>

                        Using a similar dataset as in Project 2, explore the capabilities of MongoDB (a NoSQL DBMS).
                        There are two parts to the project. Part A of the project does not use MongoDB. You will be extracting
                        data from tables in the Fakebook database and exporting a JSON file output.json that contains 
                        information about users. In Part B of the project, you will be importing output.json (or a sample.json
                        that we give you) into MongoDB to create a mongoDB collection of users. You will then need to write 
                        8 queries on the users collection. You can start on Part A right away without knowing anything about 
                        MongoDB, whereas Part B will require you to use MongoDB.
